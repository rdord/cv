 to remember.
how to love. to be fluid. playful. 
to set their inner child free. 
to laugh and dance and be. 
so many of us have forgotten how to feel.
we have become blocked off...shrunk inwards. rigid and cold...so caught up in this silly nonsense of this world. 


we forget that it is all just a game.
there are no rules here.

--

this world loves you...it is not a randomized, systematic threat.
it is all for you.
every moment.
each experience. 
when you choose to see life this way...
when you treat your existence as sacred...
when you see choose to see yourself as a living miracle, 
you become one. 

this is how magic is made.ï»¿
